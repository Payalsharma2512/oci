# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this hands-on LiveLab, you will learn how to design and deploy advanced Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) clusters using Terraform modules and OCI CLI. You will gain practical experience in building reusable, modular infrastructure components, managing dynamic environment configurations, and implementing secure, highly available, and optimized OKE clusters.

Workshop Estimated time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Provision advanced OKE clusters using Terraform modules and Oracle Resource Manager (ORM)
* Implement reusable infrastructure components including VCNs, Bastion hosts, and OKE clusters
* Apply compartment separation for security and optimized node pools for performance
* Perform node cycling and high availability configurations with minimal downtime
* Automate end-to-end cluster provisioning, updates, and teardown using Terraform CLI and OCI CLI
* (Optional) Clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account with access to OCI and necessary permissions
* Intermediate understanding of Kubernetes, networking, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
* Working knowledge of Terraform, OCI CLI, and Oracle Resource Manager

### Labs Included

* Create OKE Cluster with Terraform CLI
   - Configure variables, networking, OKE cluster, node pools, and Bastion hosts, then deploy and verify the cluster.
* Create OKE Cluster with Oracle Resource Manager (ORM)
   - Use ORM to create stacks, execute plan and apply jobs, and manage destroy operations.
* Demonstrate Key OKE Capabilities
   - Explore reusable modules, compartment separation, node cycling, high availability, and multiple node pool configurations.
